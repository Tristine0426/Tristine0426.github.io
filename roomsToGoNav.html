              <h3>Rooms To Go Mobile Navigation Process</h3>
              <p>This is a take-home assignment from Rooms To Go and my most recent work. I wanted to feature this project because I learned a lot from
                feedbback and failure while presenting this project to the stakeholders. Simply, a reminder to myself to not make the same mistake again.
              </p>
                <br>

                <p>Duration: 1 week</p>
                  <br>

                  <p><span class="bold">TASK:</span> Rooms To Go currently just list all of the different categories and sub-categories on their mobile navigation (Hamburger menu).
                      Take <span class="highlight">Furniture > Living Room & Living Room Pieces </span>section and provide an enhanced
                      merchandising experience for this portion of the navigation. The enhancement should provide a better way to
                      promote Living Rooms and Living Room pieces, along with their corresponding sub-categories.</p>

                  <h3>PROCESS</h3>
                    <p class="bold">1. USER RESEARCH</p>
                      <p>I started off with a user survey and wanted to understand the user's behaviors and their furniture searching process. The goal is to find:</p>
                        <br>
                          <p><span class="highlight">Who:</span> General demographics</p>
                          <p><span class="highlight">What:</span> Current competitors</p>
                          <p><span class="highlight">When:</span> When & how often users look for furnitures</p>
                          <p><span class="highlight">Where:</span> Online, in-store, or both</p>
                          <p><span class="highlight">Why:</span> Brand loyalty (likes and dislikes)</p>
                        <br>

                        <p><span class="bold">Results: </span>The survey was actived for 3 days. There were 25 participants. Here are my finding: </p>
                          <br>
                            <p><span class="highlight">Likes:</span> Ability to look at variety of products, reviews, ratings, sort and filter options on the vendor's website</p>
                            <p><span class="highlight">Dislikes:</span> Too many choices and unrelated products cause overwhelmingess</p>
                            <p><span class="highlight">Main competitors:</span> Ikea, Westelm, Ashley Homestore, Pottery Barn</p>
                            <p><span class="highlight">Top 5 qualities:</span> Price, Review, Color, and material</p>
                          <br>

                        <p class="bold">2. COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</p>
                          <p>How did competitors approached this?</p>
                          <img class="rtgNav" src="imagesUpdated/roomsToGo/competitors.jpg" alt="competitors screenshot">

                          <p><span class="bold">Pattern Takeaways: </span>Most competitor's navigation pattern allow users land on the results page after 3 clicks.
                            Any sub-categories or feature that further narrow down the search were either shows on top of the results page or inside the filter option.</p>

                          <br>

                          <p>What is Rooms To Go's position among competitors?</p>
                            <ul><p class="bold">Pros</p>
                              <li>Good deals when buying in sets</li>
                              <li>Multiple collections to choose from</li>
                            </ul>

                            <ul><p class="bold">Cons</p>
                              <li>Too many options to choose, takes longer to digest information, more work on the users' side</li>
                              <li>No guidance as to white category to checkout first</li>
                              <li>No reviews, comments, or feedback from the buyer about the items</li>
                            </ul>

                    <br>

                    <p class="bold">3. INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE</p>
                      <p>I wanted to work on the information architecture of the navigation process to see if I can break down the process further to improve the amount of information being present at once.</p>
                        <img class="rtgNav" src="imagesUpdated/roomsToGo/idea.png" alt="idea screenshot">

                      <p>Why have a suggestion area?</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Less decision taking time</li>
                        <li>Build trust in the product because others have bought it and love it</li>
                        <li>They trust the product will be durable</li>
                        <li>They trust the product will worth the price</li>
                        <li>Easy to find products that aligned with users’ vision and lifestyle</li>
                        <li>Build trust in products and company in the long-term</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p class="bold">4. DESIGN</p>
                        <p>I moved on to creating sketches to see how the suggestion area would look like.</p>
                          <img class="rtg" src="imagesUpdated/roomsToGo/navSketches.jpg" alt="sketchesscreenshot">
                          <p><span class="bold">Mistake: </span> I realized I was creating sketches for the <span class="highlight">mobile application</span> rather than
                            the <span class="highlight">mobile view of the website</span>. This limited the layout drastically as the hamburger navigation layout should be
                            consistent with the website.</p>

                          <br>
                            <span class="underline"><p>High Fidelity</p></span>
                              <p>I narrowed down to a couple ideas. I decided to eliminate version 1 because it would not look consistent in the default website format.</p>
                                <img class="rtgNav" src="imagesUpdated/roomsToGo/navVersions.jpg" alt="idea versions screenshot">

                                <span class="underline"><p>Default Desktop & Mobile Heights</p></span>
                                  <p>I decided to see these versions in the default desktop height (900px) and mobile height (640px).
                                    This helps to see how much the user can view when the page load before having to scroll down.
                                    I eliminated version 2 because users will have to scroll to the most. If we deploy a new layout, users are so used to seeing the old version they will get confused as to where the old contents are on the page.
                                    I’m looking to keep a version where it is intuitive to locate the old contents (furniture pieces).</p>
                                    <img class="rtgNav" src="imagesUpdated/roomsToGo/cutOff.jpg" alt="round 2 screenshot">

                                    <span class="underline"><p>Final Version</p></span>
                                      <p>I picked version 4 because I feel that at this navigation level,
                                        users are more concerns with shopping by furniture pieces. The color and material options can be included in the filter option in the results page.</p>
                                        <img class="rtgNav" src="imagesUpdated/roomsToGo/finalFlow.png" alt="final flow screenshot">
                <p class="bold">5. KPI</p>
                  <p>In order to know if the suggested design is an improvement version of the current process. Some key performance indicators can be measured as follow:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>How long did it takes for the user to go through the navigation process compare to the current process. (Did we save time or wasted more?)</li>
                      <li>Increase/decrease in use of search button right after using the menu navigation. (Did users get lost and resort to use the search button instead?)</li>
                      <li>Are there any increase or decrease in sales of living room sets & pieces?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="bold">6. Post-Presentation Iteration</p>
                      <p>After the presentation. I learned the main concern was whether the <span class="highlight">shop by style</span> will show the results in furniture pieces or furniture sets. I realized showing both in the result page is contradicting to making the page less overwhelming.
                        As a result, I decided to move the <span class="highlight">shop by style</span> inside the shop by pieces. This will now only show the furniture pieces instead of showing both sets and pieces.</p>
