                    <h3>Self-learner | cat advocate | food enthusiast.</h3>
                      <p>I’m a designer with a background in Management Information Systems.
                        My background helped me learn to code and nurtured my goal to create user-centered design.
                        I care for homeless cats in the community.
                        My passion to help animals enhances my ability to empathize with user’s needs.</p>

        <ul class="grid1">
          <li><h1>What's your journey?</h1></li>

          <li><p>My journey started in 2005 when I moved to the U.S.
            I spent most of my time online reading manga and talking to friends as a way to cope with being homesick.
            This started my interest in creating online forums, finding visual templates, and playing around with the code to customize it.
            I loved playing around with mySpace at the time.</p></li>

          <li><img src="imagesUpdated/p1.png" alt="discover"></li>

          <li><p>When I started High School, I decided to take 2 years of web design.
              This turned out to be a disappointment. All we did was learning HTML and Dreamweaver, which had little to no creative aspect.
              I didn’t know CSS existed, so I thought it was the limit of design.</p>

          <li><p>At the end of high school, I remembered running across UI/UX design while researching for a college major.
                It seems at the time, the industry was quite young. There was no degree specified for it.
                There were also limited college classes offered. In the end, I decided to still submerge myself in the
                technology industry. So, I majored in Management Information Systems.</p>

          <li><p>Post-college job hunt was brutal. My passion was not in the field I studied.
                  The more I tried to covered up and acted as if I was pursuing the right path, the more miserable I felt.</p>

          <li><img class="img2" src="imagesUpdated/p2.jpg" alt="discover">

          <li><p>I realized, I cannot go anywhere without a passion.</p>

          <li><p>So I decided to re-evaluate what I enjoyed most.
                    That’s when I came across UI/UX design again.
                    The industry had grown quite a bit. It’s now easy defined and is vital everywhere.
                    It surprised me how much it could affect our lives.
                    A pretty design is the top of the iceberg.
                    A successful design is one that changes the way people see and experience things.
                    It changes perspectives, it informs, it persuades, and it’s powerful.</p></li>

          <li><p>I realized I’ve always gravitated to it like a magnet ever since 2005.
                      UI/UX design matches with my interest in creativity, technology, and psychology.</p></li>

          <li><p>Having the gut to start over and invest in myself is my biggest accomplishment. It’s a big risk. A good one. I learned a lot and enjoyed what I do;
                        even through the painstaking process, getting out of my comfort zone, and spending hours researching.
                        In short, there is no other I enjoy doing. </p></li>

          <li><p>So here I am, making a difference through design.</p></li>
