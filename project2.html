            <p>TNRHumane is an Android mobile application that allows users to report homeless cats
              and alert volunteers or animal organizations to come and Trap, Neuter, and Return feral cats
              to its environment. The app will help find homes for abandoned animals,
              provide food/medical care, connect caretakers through social media feature,
              and act as a humane solution to reduce feral cats overpopulation.

              A pair of unfixed cats can multiply up to 32 cats within 16 months.
              While many often feed them, others
              see them as a nuisance.
              Thus, creating problems such as:

                <ul>
                  <li>Animosity towards homeless cats and feeders </li>
                  <li>Risk of human-transmitted diseases </li>
                  <li>Risk of animal abuse </li>
                  <li>Kittens born suffer and die in the wild.</li>

                      It has no support for interactivity among users.
                      Because the app works worldwide, the chances for someone in the U.S to use it to

                      extremely low.

                   Red and pink were my top choices. I went with pink because using red as
                   primary color could be problematic. For example, red usually associated

                   I noticed that it is rounder and has more latter space.
                   Because TNRHumane is an Android application, using a similar

                      <p>I decided to pick option B, however, while double checking with
                        the Material Guidelines, it was recommended to use a floating button
                        with caution when navigation options are present.
                        Since my navigation tab included words, I thought it would be
                        crowded with the floating button. Moreover, users are more likely
                        to keep in touch with events and TNR deals than writing a post.
                        Thus, I gear the screen’s focus toward posts from organizations
                        than for a user to write posts</p>

             <h3>USABILITY TEST ROUND 2</h3>
              <p>This iteration then used to perform another usability tests:
                1 recorded remote test and a <em class="bold">Maze</em> test (14 - 21 participants)</p>
               <br>
               <p>Overall, participants had the most problem with the 1st task,
                 causing many to give up on the rest of the test.
                 Task 1 asked participants to fill out a report without sign in.
                 Many did the opposite and clicked the <em class="bold">“sign in”</em> button,
                 which caused confusion
                 and participants were unable to complete the task.
                 Others clicked <em class="bold">“skip”</em>, which allow them to complete the task,
                 but they did not know what the report is for, what is TNR, or why they are filling
                 out a report. </p>
              <br>
              <p>I learned that users are impulsive and will click on options that are
                present to them. Ultimately, I decided to get rid of both <em class="bold">“skip” </em>
                and <em class="bold">“sign in”</em> button to guide the users through the tutorial.</p>

           <h2>WHAT I LEARNED</h2>
             <p><em class="bold">Brainstorming in multiple sessions:</em>
               The hardest part of this project
               was how to get started. The concept is fairly new and there were
               limited apps with this concept. I knew some user frustrations and
               goals from personal experience as a volunteer, I have some ideas and
               features I wanted to create but was overwhelmed when thinking about
               organizing the user flow. Ultimately, I did many brainstorming sessions,
               taking breaks in between to refresh my mind and repeat.
               This process helps me put my thoughts out in intervals,
               be able to analyze ideas, and branch out from those ideas.</p>
              <br>
              <P><em class="bold">Sorting Competitors when there is none:</em>
                Another challenge was finding a competitor to analyze.
                There was only one app developed in India that addresses
                the stray animals problems. None in the U.S.
                So I decided to pick my competitors based on the basic features
                I wanted to develop. For example, I wanted to have a social feature
                to connect with local volunteers and allow users to keep updates
                from fundraising events, training, low-cost clinics, etc.
                I studied FaceBook, Instagram, Pawpular, ASPCA, Twitter, LinkedIn.
                This helped me learn basic social media structures, what they
                all have in commons, why are they different? What are their differences?
                How their users interact with the platform?</p>
              <br>
              <p><em class="bold">More options, more confusions:</em>
                While conducting the 2nd usability test, I see that users will
                click on buttons to explore or find the shortest way to complete the task.
                This caused confusion as they did not know what they are doing, its
                purpose, and how they got to the screen they are at.  </P>
