            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Craigslist is an advertisement site for users to buy, sell, and trade locally at no cost to the sellers.
              It’s a platform to advertise household items, liquidated merchandise, lands, houses, and offer handy services,
              find job postings, explore local communities as well as participating in discussion forums.

            <p>It’s proven that customers overlooked Craigslist’s interface for its simple workflow.
              The business strategy works. I wanted to keep applying the business strategy
              (assuming it this will be the same for years to come) while improving their interface elements such as:</P>

                <ul>
                  <li>Clean up sub-categories naming and titles</li>

                    <h3>UNDERSTANDING THE USERS</h3>
                      <p>After reading through many reviews and customer’s opinions. There are 3 main reasons why some prefer to use Craigslist:</P>
                        <br>
                          <p><span class="bold">Simple:</span> The interface is simple enough to use even for those who are older and not familiar with the Internet.</p>
                            <br>
                             <p><span class="bold">No Commitment:</span> Users do what they need to do (buy, sell, trade) without needing an account.
                               They don’t feel being lure or tempted to keep coming back to spend money.
                               Where as e-commerce sites these days show options like “Today’s Deals”, “Based on Your Last Purchase” ,
                               “Things You May Like”, etc.
                               This keep users scrolling and eventually buying more than they need to.</p>
                                <br>
                                  <p><span class="bold">Convenience:</span> Whatever seller sells, they keep all of their profits without shipping cost.</p>

             <h6>Takeaways</h6>
              <p>The main complain for Craigslist post is the amount of spams, trust-worthy comes in second, and there were confusions over the options on the home page.
                  I noticed these complains that create negativity torward Craigslist are due to how the users use the platform to advertise their contents.
                  Craigslist currently only have 25 employees to maintain the site. Thus, my goal is to create cleaner porduct categories and interfaces to develop a more trust-worthy feel to the platform.
                  In regard to spam issue, I will tackle this problem when designing the interface for the posting process when users can only post a certain amount of posts per day.

                  <p>Based on the survey and the competitive analysis, whereas Craigslist has tremendous problems with spams and scam posts, its competitorss proved to have more control of the platform to counter this problem. For example,
                  Letgo prohibit certain items and generate title for posts; Facebook and OfferUp provide much more customer support and provide user verification to establish trust.</p>

                <h3>USER STORIES</h3>
                 <p>With a general idea of the user’s goals and frustrations, I created a user story for sellers and buyers.
                    This process defined and prioritized tasks all users should be able to do, ranging from low, medium, to high.</p>

               <h3>COLOR & STYLE GUIDE</h3>
                 <p>Colorwise, I went with the classic hue that represents compassion.
                   Red and pink were my top choices. I went with pink because using red as
                   primary color could be problematic. For example, red usually associated
                   with an error. </P>
                 <br>
                 <P>As for typeface, I picked Prompt. It is user-friendly and easy to see.
                   Moreover, Google Application recently updated their typefaces.
                   I noticed that it is rounder and has more latter space.
                   Because TNRHumane is an Android application, using a similar
                   typeface provide familiarity. </p>

           <h2>WHAT I LEARNED</h2>
             <p><em class="bold">Brainstorming in multiple sessions:</em>
               The hardest part of this project
               was how to get started. The concept is fairly new and there were
               limited apps with this concept. I knew some user frustrations and
               goals from personal experience as a volunteer, I have some ideas and
               features I wanted to create but was overwhelmed when thinking about
               organizing the user flow. Ultimately, I did many brainstorming sessions,
               taking breaks in between to refresh my mind and repeat.
               This process helps me put my thoughts out in intervals,
               be able to analyze ideas, and branch out from those ideas.</p>
              <br>
              <P><em class="bold">Sorting Competitors when there is none:</em>
                Another challenge was finding a competitor to analyze.
                There was only one app developed in India that addresses
                the stray animals problems. None in the U.S.
                So I decided to pick my competitors based on the basic features
                I wanted to develop. For example, I wanted to have a social feature
                to connect with local volunteers and allow users to keep updates
                from fundraising events, training, low-cost clinics, etc.
                I studied FaceBook, Instagram, Pawpular, ASPCA, Twitter, LinkedIn.
                This helped me learn basic social media structures, what they
                all have in commons, why are they different? What are their differences?
                How their users interact with the platform?</p>
              <br>
              <p><em class="bold">More options, more confusions:</em>
                While conducting the 2nd usability test, I see that users will
                click on buttons to explore or find the shortest way to complete the task.
                This caused confusion as they did not know what they are doing, its
                purpose, and how they got to the screen they are at.  </P>
